# ML-project
This is a machine learning project done on contingency analysis of power systems. It makes use of Graph Neural Networks, which also learns patterns and networks from the sorroundings. The goal is for the user to input any IEEE bus system closest to their power network, along with load/scale conditions and get the graph along with Excel data for the critical/non critical elements.
